           Parallel Programming Interface for Distributed Data
           ===================================================

 This package provides the Parallel Programming Interface for
 Distributed Data (PPIDD) library.

 1. Prerequisites

    - GNU make

    - A C++ compiler

    - If compiling Fortran interface, a Fortran compiler which supports
      Fortran 2003 Standard features

    - An MPI library

    OR

    - Global Arrays library and MPI library

      We strongly recommend that the same compilers are used for
      compiling the Global Arrays and PPIDD libraries.

 2. Building the library

    By default configure will build the library for serial, one should
    therefore specify --with-ga or --with-mpi2 to build a parallel
    interface. The normal autoconf influential variables can be used
    with configure, run ./configure --help for full details.

    Building examples are avaible at ./doc/doxygen/html/index.html after the documentation is built.

 3. Testing the library

    Once the library has been built successfully some tests will appear
    in the 'test' directory, identifiable by an .exe suffix. These tests
    should be run in order to check the library is working correctly, eg.

    mpiexec -np 4 ./test/ppidd_test.exe

    A sample output for this test can be found at ./test/ppidd_test.out (please be aware the results
    are machine-dependent).

 4. Building the documentation

    This should not be necessary since PPIDD is distributed with
    documentation precompiled. If you should choose to recompile, then
    the doxygen program is required.

    doxygen src/Doxyfile

 5. Directory and file structure

    Inside of the PPIDD root directory, the following files and subirectories
    are distributed:
       .
       |-- GNUmakefile                        Makefile to build PPIDD
       |-- README                             README for PPIDD
       |-- ./doc                              Document directory
       |-- ./src                              Source code directory for PPIDD library
       |-- ./test                             Test code directory for PPIDD library

    For more details, please see ./doc/doxygen/html/index.html after the documentation is built.

 6. Questions

    The distribution has been tested by us on a variety of machines in our environments. If you
    have any problem about the PPIDD (including installation, usage, bug report, suggestion etc),
    please send an email to molpro@molpro.net.
